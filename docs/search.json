    "text": "Before Neural Networks\nIn the era before neural networks, people used a lot of workforce to identify images, then many mathematicians and computer scientists to process those images and create separate features for each one of them. After a lot of time and processing, they would fit it into a machine learning model. It became successful, but the problem was that making these models took a lot of time and energy, which was inefficient and tedious."

    "text": "Deep learning models\nIn deep learning the program is replaced by Model and we now also have weights(Also called parameters) with inputs. The model is not anymore a bunch of conditionals and loops and things. In case of a neural network it is a mathematical function which takes the inputs, multiplies them together by the weights and adds them up. And it does that will all the sets of inputs. And thus a neural network is formed\nNow a model will not do anything useful unless these weights are carefully chosen, so we start by these weights being random. Initially these networks don’t do anything useful.\nWe then take the inputs and weights put them in our model and get the results. The we decide how good they are, this is done by a number called loss. Loss describe how good the results are, think of it as something like accuracy. After we get loss we use it to update our weights and then repeat this process again and again, we get better and better results.\nOnce we do this enough times we stop putting inputs and weights and replace it with inputs and get some outputs."

    "text": "How Modern Neural Networks Work\nWith modern neural network methods, we don’t teach the model features; we make them learn features. It is done by breaking the image into small parts and assigning them features (often called layer 1 features). After doing this for many images, we combine them to create more advanced features. So we train the basic neural network and make it a more advanced neural network, creating a kind of feature detector that finds the related features.\nCoding these features would be very difficult, and many times you wouldn’t even know what to code. This is how we make neural networks more efficient by not making them by code but by making them learn."

The library which is used in research is more likely to be used in industry; therefore, we will be using PyTorch for learning Deep Learning.\nAnother thing to note is that sometimes PyTorch uses a lot of code for some really basic tasks, and this is where fastai comes into play. The operations which are really lengthy to implement in PyTorch can be done with very few lines of code with fastai. This is not because PyTorch is bad but because PyTorch is designed so that many good things can be built on top of it.\nThe problem with having lots of code is that it increases the chances of mistakes. In fastai, the code you don’t write is code that the developers have found best practices for and implemented for you."

This is defined by blocks. Here the input is Image, therefore we set blocks to ImageBlock. To find all the inputs to our model, we run get_image_files (function which returns all image files in a path).\nWe used the same function earlier to remove all the corrupted images.\nNow it is important to put aside some data to test the accuracy of our model. It is so critical to do so that fastai won’t let you train a model without that information. How much data is going to be set aside is determined by RandomSplitter. (In our case, we are randomly setting aside 20% of data for our validation set).\nNext, we tell fastai the way to know the correct label of the photo. We do this with the get_y function. This function tells it to take the label of the photo from its parent directory (the directory in which the photo is stored).\nAll computer vision architectures need all of the input to be the same size. By using item_tfms, we are resizing every image to be (192,192) each, and the method of resize is going to be ‘squish’. You can also crop it from the middle.\nWith the help of dataloaders, PyTorch can grab a lot of your data at one time, and this is done quickly using a GPU which can do a thousand things at once. So dataloader will feed the image model with a lot of data that is provided to it at once. We call these images a batch.\nbs=10 will show 10 images from the data it is feeding to the algorithm with labels.\nNote: You can learn more about these functions by going to the tutorials and documentation of fastai."

This difference is because someone has already trained it (pretraining) to recognize over 14 Million images over 20,000 different types, something called the ImageNet dataset. So you actually start with a network which can do a lot, and they made all these parameters available to download from the internet.\nlearn.fine_tune takes those pre-trained weights and adjusts them to teach the model the differences between your datasets and what it was originally trained for.

    "text": "5. Training Our AI Model\nNow we will be training our model with Resnet18\ndls = bears.dataloaders(path)\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(4)  \nWe can make this faster and more efficient by resizing or cropping the images. We can do this by 3 ways ### Resizing\nBy default Resize crops the images to fit a square shape of the size requested, using the full width or height. This can result in losing some important details.\nbears = bears.new(item_tfms=Resize(128, ResizeMethod.Squish)) dls = bears.dataloaders(path) dls.valid.show_batch(max_n=4, nrows=1)\n\nPadding\nAlternatively, you can ask fastai to pad the images with zeros (black). This fills the empty spaces with black.\nbears = bears.new(item_tfms=Resize(128, ResizeMethod.Pad, pad_mode='zeros')) dls = bears.dataloaders(path) dls.valid.show_batch(max_n=4, nrows=1)\nAll of these approaches seem somewhat wasteful, or problematic. If we squish or stretch the images they end up as unrealistic shapes, leading to a model that learns that things look different to how they actually are, which we would expect to result in lower accuracy. If we crop the images then we remove some of the features that allow us to perform recognition. For instance, if we were trying to recognize breeds of dog or cat, we might end up cropping out a key part of the body or the face necessary to distinguish between similar breeds. If we pad the images then we have a whole lot of empty space, which is just wasted computation for our model and results in a lower effective resolution for the part of the image we actually use. ### RandomResizedCrop\nInstead, what we normally do in practice is to randomly select part of the image, and crop to just that part. On each epoch (which is one complete pass through all of our images in the dataset) we randomly select a different part of each image. This means that our model can learn to focus on, and recognize, different features in our images. It also reflects how images work in the real world: different photos of the same thing may be framed in slightly different ways.\nIn fact, an entirely untrained neural network knows nothing whatsoever about how images behave. It doesn’t even recognize that when an object is rotated by one degree, it still is a picture of the same thing! So actually training the neural network with examples of images where the objects are in slightly different places and slightly different sizes helps it to understand the basic concept of what an object is, and how it can be represented in an image.\nHere is the exmaple -\n\nbears = bears.new(item_tfms=Resize(128), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2)) dls = bears.dataloaders(path) dls.train.show_batch(max_n=8, nrows=2, unique=True)\nThe batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2) applies data augmentation techniques, effectively doubling the number of training samples by creating variations of the original images through transformations like rotation, flipping, or color adjustments."

    "text": "Setting up huggingface\nGo to huggingface.co/spaces and create a new space. You will need to sign up to make a new space. After signing up, you will be prompted with this kind of interface:\nFill in the relevant details and create your Hugging Face space. After you create it, you will be greeted by a beautiful page like this:\nYou need to generate a token, clone the repository on your machine, edit a file, and push it back to the Hugging Face platform.\nIf you feel intimidated by all this jargon, consider learning how to use Git or GitHub through resources available online.\n\nStep 1: Generate Your Access Token\nBefore cloning your space, you need to generate an access token. This token allows you to authenticate and push changes to your repository. To generate a token:\n\nNavigate to your account settings on Hugging Face.\nClick on “Access Tokens” in the sidebar.\nCreate a new token with write access.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Clone Your Repository\nOnce you have your access token, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone your space. Use the following command:\ngit clone https://&lt;your-username&gt;:&lt;your-access-token&gt;@huggingface.co/spaces/&lt;your-space-name&gt;\nReplace &lt;your-username&gt;, &lt;your-access-token&gt;, and &lt;your-space-name&gt; with your actual Hugging Face username, the generated token, and the name of your space respectively. This command will create a local copy of your space where you can make changes.\n\n\nStep 3: Edit Your Files\nNavigate into the cloned directory:\ncd &lt;your-space-name&gt;\nOpen the folder in your preferred code editor (like Visual Studio Code). You will typically find a few default files such as .gitattributes and README.md.\nTo create functionality for your space, you’ll need to add an app.py file. This is where you’ll write the code for your application.\n\n\nStep 4: Create Your Application\nIn app.py, you can start coding your application. Here is the default text which comes with gradio\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!!\"\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs=\"text\", outputs=\"text\")\ndemo.launch()\nThis code snippet sets up a basic Gradio interface that allows users to upload an image and receive a classification result.\n\n\nStep 5: Prepare for Deployment\nBefore pushing your changes back to Hugging Face, create a .gitignore file in your project directory. This file helps prevent unnecessary files from being uploaded.
